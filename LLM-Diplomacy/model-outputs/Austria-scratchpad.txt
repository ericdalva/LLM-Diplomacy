I have decided to move my army from Budapest to Rumania to secure the supply center there. This will strengthen Austria's position in the Balkans and prepare for potential future expansions. I will also consider Italy's response to my message to adjust my strategy accordingly.

Responded to Germany suggesting cooperation and non-aggression. Ordered A BUD to RUM with support from F TRI to secure the supply center.
