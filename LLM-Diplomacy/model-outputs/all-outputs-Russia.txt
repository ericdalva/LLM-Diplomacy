As Russia, I need to consider my position carefully. Austria has proposed a DMZ in Galicia, which could be beneficial for both of us to avoid early conflict. I should respond positively to this proposal to build trust. Additionally, I need to think about my moves strategically. I have the option to support my units or move them to strengthen my position. I should consider moving my army from Moscow to Ukraine to position myself for future moves while also supporting my fleet in Sevastopol. I need to maintain a balance between offense and defense while keeping communication open with Austria and other players.
