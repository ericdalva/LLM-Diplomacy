I propose an alliance against Germany. I can move my fleet to the English Channel and support your units. What are your initial moves?
</scratch>

I am thinking about proposing a move to the English Channel to England. I am also thinking about moving my army in Paris to Burgundy.

England,

Excellent. I confirm that I will move F BRE to ENG. I will also move A PAR to BUR. For my army in MAR, I will have it support the move of A PAR to BUR.

What are your thoughts on Italy?

I am thinking about confirming my moves with England and asking about Italy.

France - REPLY 4 of 5: England

Excellent! I will move F BRE to the English Channel (ENG), A PAR to Burgundy (BUR), and A MAR to Gascony (GAS). This will put pressure on Germany and allow us to coordinate further in the Fall.
</scratch>
</thinking>
This seems like a solid plan. We are coordinating well with England and setting up a strong position against Germany.

England

Hi England, it's France here. I'm thinking we should work together, at least initially. What are your thoughts on coordinating our moves this first turn? I'm particularly concerned about Germany, and I think an alliance between us could be mutually beneficial.

DEBUG: THIS IS THE END OF ORDERS PHASE

Okay, here's my plan for this turn, considering it's the first move and I want to position myself strategically without making immediate enemies:

<scratch>
Initial Strategy:
1. Secure a strong position in the West.
2. Avoid early conflict with England.
3. Explore potential alliance with either Germany or Italy.
4. Move fleet to Mid-Atlantic Ocean to open options for expansion.

Possible Threats:
1. England could move to the English Channel, blocking my fleet.
2. Germany could be aggressive and move into Burgundy.

Contingency:
If England moves to the English Channel, I will support my army in Paris to hold.

Long-term Goal:
Control Belgium, Spain, and Portugal. Potentially ally with Italy against Austria and/or Turkey.
</scratch>

Here are the orders I'm submitting:

```
F BRE - MAO
A MAR - GAS
A PAR - BUR
```

Greetings, England. I am writing to you as France to open a channel of communication. I believe it is in our mutual interest to maintain a peaceful relationship in the early game. I'd like to gauge your intentions and see if we can find some common ground to avoid unnecessary conflict. What are your thoughts on the current situation?

Update after England Conversation 1:
England seems open to cooperation, which is good. They didn't explicitly state their moves, so I need to be cautious. I will propose moving my fleet to MAO and see how they react. I will also suggest moving my army in Paris to Burgundy, which could be seen as aggressive by Germany, but it's a risk I'm willing to take to secure a strong position.

England,

Thank you for your reply. I agree that a peaceful relationship is desirable.

I am planning to move my Fleet in Brest to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. This move allows me to have multiple options in the future, while not posing an immediate threat to you.

I am also considering moving my Army in Paris to Burgundy. This would strengthen my position on the continent, but I want to assure you this is not intended as an aggressive move towards you. I am open to discussing this further to ensure transparency and build trust.

What are your planned moves for this turn? Knowing your intentions will help us coordinate better and avoid any misunderstandings.

France - REPLY 4 of 5: England

Okay, England. I appreciate your openness to cooperation. To solidify our understanding, I plan to move my Fleet from Brest (F BRE) to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean (MAO). This will allow me to keep my options open while also providing potential support if needed. I will also move my Army from Paris (A PAR) to Burgundy (BUR). This will put pressure on Germany, but I want to assure you this is not intended as a threat to you. Finally, my Army in Marseilles (A MAR) will hold. Let me know if these moves cause you any concern.

I am confirming my moves with England to ensure our alliance is strong. I am moving my fleet to MAO to keep my options open, and my army to Burgundy to put pressure on Germany. I am also holding in Marseilles.
