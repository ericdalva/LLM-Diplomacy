2. Germany could be aggressive and move into Burgundy.

Contingency:
If England moves to the English Channel, I will support my army in Paris to hold.

Long-term Goal:
Control Belgium, Spain, and Portugal. Potentially ally with Italy against Austria and/or Turkey.

Update after England Conversation 1:
England seems open to cooperation, which is good. They didn't explicitly state their moves, so I need to be cautious. I will propose moving my fleet to MAO and see how they react. I will also suggest moving my army in Paris to Burgundy, which could be seen as aggressive by Germany, but it's a risk I'm willing to take to secure a strong position.
