It seems like there was an error in receiving Austria's response. Let's try to proceed with the conversation and see if we can get a response from Austria.

Turkey - MESSAGE: Austria
I hope you're doing well. I'd like to reiterate my interest in discussing a potential alliance or non-aggression pact between our nations. As neighboring powers, it's crucial we maintain open communication to avoid any misunderstandings. Could you please share your thoughts on the current situation and how you envision our relationship unfolding in the coming seasons?

If I don't receive a response, I'll have to rely on my own judgment and analysis of the board to make decisions.

Austria - REPLY 4 of 5: 
It seems like there's been a technical issue with our conversation. Let's try to focus on the game at hand. As Austria, I'm interested in discussing a potential non-aggression pact with you, Turkey. I believe it would be beneficial for both our powers to have a secure border and focus on expanding in other areas. What are your thoughts on this proposal? 

Please respond with your intentions, and we can discuss further details. If we can come to an agreement, I'd like to propose that we both support each other in our respective expansions, at least for the time being. 

Let's work together to create a stable environment for our powers to grow.

DEBUG: THIS IS THE END OF ORDERS PHASE

=== Thu Feb  6 13:09:50 2025 ===
Given the current situation and the goal of winning the game by controlling 18 supply centers, I will focus on securing my position, potentially forming alliances, and making strategic moves to expand my territory.

Considering the initial setup and the fact that I've initiated conversations with Austria, my primary aim is to ensure a stable eastern front and potentially gain an advantage in the Balkans.

My orders for the first move are:

1. A CON - BUL
2. A SMY - ARM
3. F ANK - BLA

These moves are designed to:

- Move A CON to BUL, securing a potential foothold in the Balkans and preparing for further expansion or defense, depending on the response from Austria and other powers.
- Advance A SMY to ARM, positioning myself for potential expansion into the Middle East or as a defensive measure against Russia.
- Move F ANK to BLA, preparing to potentially support A CON in the Balkans or to move into the Black Sea, depending on the diplomatic situation and the moves of other powers.

These moves are cautious, aiming to secure my borders and prepare for future expansion while awaiting the responses from other powers, especially Austria, to determine the best course of action for forming alliances or identifying potential threats.
