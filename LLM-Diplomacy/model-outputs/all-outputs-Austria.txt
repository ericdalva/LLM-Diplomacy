This is the start of the game, so I need to focus on building relationships and securing my borders. Italy and Turkey are my immediate neighbors and potential threats, so I need to communicate with them. Russia is also a potential threat in the long term. Germany and France are too far away to be immediate concerns, but I should still send them a message. England is the furthest away and least concerning.

My initial moves should be conservative, focusing on securing my supply centers and preparing for potential conflicts. I want to avoid any early wars if possible. I will try to get Italy to agree to a DMZ in Venice and Turkey to agree to a DMZ in Serbia. I will also try to get Russia to agree to a DMZ in Galicia.

Okay, it's Spring 1901. My primary goal is survival and expansion. I need to solidify my position and avoid early wars. I have DMZs proposed with Italy, Turkey, and Russia. I need to reinforce these agreements and start planning for the future. Italy is my most immediate concern, as Venice is a juicy target. I need to keep them friendly for now. Russia and Turkey are longer-term threats, but I need to keep them from uniting against me. Germany and France are distant, so maintaining good relations is beneficial.

My moves this turn should focus on securing my borders and probing for weaknesses. Moving A VIE to TRI is a good way to support a potential move into Venice later, or to defend against an Italian attack. Moving A BUD to SER is risky, as it could be seen as aggressive by Turkey, but it also opens up options in the Balkans. F TRI to ALB is a good move to secure the Adriatic and potentially support an attack on Greece later.

I will focus my diplomatic efforts on solidifying the DMZs and building trust with Germany and France. I will also probe Italy's intentions and try to get a better sense of their long-term goals.

The situation remains largely unchanged. I need to continue building trust with Germany and France while probing Italy and Turkey for potential alliances. Russia remains neutral, and I should maintain the DMZ in Galicia. My immediate goal is to secure the Balkans, so I will continue to hold Serbia. I will also continue to offer Trieste to Italy for a full alliance and Rumania to Turkey for a full alliance.

I need to continue building trust with Germany and France while solidifying my position in the Balkans. Italy is being difficult, but I need to keep the pressure on for an alliance. Turkey is offering a NAP, which could be beneficial in the long run, but I need to be careful not to become isolated. Russia is moving to Warsaw, which is concerning, but I need to maintain the DMZ in Galicia.

My priorities for this turn are:
1. Secure Serbia
2. Continue to court Italy for an alliance
3. Maintain the DMZ with Russia
4. Continue to build trust with Germany and France
5. Consider Turkey's NAP offer

I will continue to hold Serbia and support it with Vienna. I will move my fleet to the Adriatic to support future expansion.

**Thinking:**
<think>
I need to decide on my moves for this turn. I have been holding in Serbia for the past two turns, which has not been productive. I need to decide whether to continue holding, or to make a move. I am still trying to get Italy on my side, and I have offered them Trieste in exchange for a full alliance. I am also trying to get Turkey to agree to a non-aggression pact. Russia is moving to Warsaw, which is concerning. I need to be careful not to provoke them. Germany is my ally, and I need to continue to work with them to contain Russia and France. France is also friendly, and I need to continue to work with them to contain Germany.

My priorities for this turn are:
1. Secure an alliance with Italy.
2. Secure a non-aggression pact with Turkey.
3. Monitor Russia's movements.
4. Continue to work with Germany and France to maintain the balance of power in Europe.

I will move my army from Serbia to Rumania to secure a supply center and to put pressure on Russia. I will move my fleet from Albania to the Ionian Sea to support my army in Rumania. I will support my army in Vienna to hold.

I will continue to try to negotiate an alliance with Italy and a non-aggression pact with Turkey. I will also continue to monitor Russia's movements and work with Germany and France to maintain the balance of power in Europe.
