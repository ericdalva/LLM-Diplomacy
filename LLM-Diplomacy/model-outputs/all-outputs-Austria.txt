**Message to Italy:**

Italy,  

Greetings! I hope this message finds you well. As we begin this game, I wanted to reach out to discuss how we might coordinate our moves to our mutual benefit. Both our nations are well-positioned to influence the Mediterranean and the Balkans, and I believe an alliance could be advantageous for both of us.  

I am particularly interested in ensuring stability in the region and preventing any single power from dominating. If you're open to it, I'd love to discuss how we can support each other, whether through mutual defense or coordinated expansion. Let me know your thoughts!  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Austria

I have decided to move my army from Budapest to Rumania to secure the supply center there. This will strengthen Austria's position in the Balkans and prepare for potential future expansions. I will also consider Italy's response to my message to adjust my strategy accordingly.

To secure the supply center in Rumania and strengthen Austria's position, I will move the army from Budapest to Rumania with support from the army in Vienna. The fleet in Trieste will hold its position.

To Germany:

I appreciate your message and willingness to discuss cooperation. As Austria, I am open to a mutual non-aggression pact and potential collaboration against common threats. Let us focus on securing our positions and considering how we can assist each other without conflicting interests. A strong Austria and Germany can deter other powers and create opportunities for expansion.

**Orders:**
- A BUD - RUM
- F TRI S A BUD - RUM

Responded to Germany suggesting cooperation and non-aggression. Ordered A BUD to RUM with support from F TRI to secure the supply center.

To address the current situation as Austria, I will proceed with the following strategy:

1. **Secure Rumania**: Move the army from Budapest (A BUD) to Rumania (RUM) with support from the fleet in Trieste (F TRI). This will capture the supply center and strengthen Austria's position in the Balkans.

2. **Maintain Diplomatic Relations**: Continue communication with Germany to uphold a non-aggression pact, ensuring a peaceful northern border and allowing focus on expansion elsewhere.

3. **Monitor Italy and Turkey**: Be cautious of potential moves from Italy and Turkey, especially near the Balkans, and be prepared to adjust strategies if necessary.

4. **Future Expansion Planning**: After securing Rumania, consider moving towards Serbia or Bulgaria in subsequent seasons, ensuring not to overextend and maintaining defensive positions.

5. **Unit Adjustment**: Plan to build additional units in home supply centers during the adjustment phase to maintain military strength.

Orders:
- A BUD - RUM
- F TRI S A BUD - RUM

This approach aims to expand Austria's influence while maintaining strategic alliances and preparing for potential future threats.
