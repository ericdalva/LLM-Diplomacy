As Germany, my initial goal is to establish a strong foundation and secure my borders. I have three units: A BER, A MUN, and F KIE. I need to consider the messages from other players and plan my moves accordingly. Austria has expressed interest in maintaining peace, which could be beneficial for both of us. France has suggested working together, which might be a good opportunity to discuss arrangements regarding Belgium. I should respond to these messages and start building alliances while also considering my possible moves.
