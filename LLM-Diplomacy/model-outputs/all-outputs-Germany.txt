Austria

I'm Germany, and I'd like to discuss our shared border and potential opportunities for cooperation. What are your thoughts on the current situation, and do you have any proposals for how we can work together to achieve our goals?

Austria - MESSAGE 2 of 5: 

I agree that a strong Austria and Germany can be mutually beneficial. I'm interested in discussing potential cooperation against Russia, as their expansion could pose a threat to both of our interests. What are your thoughts on a possible alliance or joint action against Russia?

Also, I'd like to propose a demilitarized zone along our shared border, specifically in Bohemia and Silesia, to avoid any unnecessary conflicts and focus on external threats.
