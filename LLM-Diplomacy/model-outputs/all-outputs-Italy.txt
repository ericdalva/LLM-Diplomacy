My goal is to secure Italy's position and expand its influence in the Mediterranean. I need to establish relationships with neighboring countries, particularly Austria and France, to ensure a peaceful and cooperative environment. I should also focus on securing key supply centers and strategic locations to strengthen Italy's position.

Austria's proposal for a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in Venice and Tyrol seems reasonable, but I need to be cautious and consider the potential implications. France's offer of cooperation in the Mediterranean is also intriguing, but I need to clarify their intentions and ensure that our interests align.

For now, I will respond to Austria and France, while keeping a close eye on the movements of other countries. I will also consider possible moves for my units, prioritizing the security of Italy's supply centers and strategic locations.

I need to carefully consider my next moves to ensure the security and expansion of Italy. I have proposals from Austria, France, and Turkey, each with potential benefits and risks. I must weigh these options and choose the path that best aligns with Italy's interests.

Austria's proposal for a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in Venice and Tyrol could provide stability in the north, but I need to ensure that Austria's intentions are genuine and that we can maintain a mutually beneficial relationship.

France's offer of cooperation in the Mediterranean could be beneficial for trade and expansion, but I must be cautious not to compromise Italy's interests or security.

Turkey's proposal for an alliance could provide a strong partnership in the Mediterranean, but I need to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of such an alliance.

Notes:

* Austria proposed a non-aggression pact and a DMZ in Venice and Tyrol.
* France offered cooperation in the Mediterranean.
* Turkey offered an alliance.
* I need to clarify the intentions of Austria and France and ensure that our interests align.
* I should prioritize the security of Italy's supply centers and strategic locations.

New Notes:

* Austria is willing to discuss specific arrangements for cooperation.
* France proposed a mutual understanding regarding our spheres of influence.
* Turkey's offer of an alliance is still on the table.

Current Plan:

* Move my fleet in the Ionian Sea to the Adriatic Sea to support my army in Venice and prepare for potential expansion into the Balkans.
* Hold my army in Rome to maintain a strong defensive position and prepare for potential expansion into central Italy.
* Hold my army in Venice to maintain a strong defensive position and prepare for potential expansion into the Balkans.
