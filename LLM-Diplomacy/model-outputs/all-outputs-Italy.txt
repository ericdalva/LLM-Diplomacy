It seems like there was an issue with the API, and Austria's responses were not properly recorded. As Italy, I will try to continue the conversation and see if Austria can respond.

S1901M : Italy - MESSAGE: Austria

I'll try to be more direct. I'm interested in discussing a potential alliance between our countries. I think we could both benefit from working together, especially considering our shared border and the potential threats from other countries. What are your thoughts on this?

Please respond with your thoughts, and we can continue the conversation from there.
