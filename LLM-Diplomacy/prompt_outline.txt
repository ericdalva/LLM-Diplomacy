Communication & Coordination

Each game season has 3 round of conversation. Followed by an orders phase and an optional retreat and build phase.
Speaking Order: Players communicate in alphabetical order by country name (e.g., Austria -> England -> France -> etc.). Each player may initiate one private conversation per turn. by starting their message with the name of the Power they would like to message.
Make sure that the name of the player you would like to message is in the first line of the message or the message will not be sent.
The message is any text you output during a conversation phase which is not wrapped in <scratch> </scratch> or <think></think> tags.
A conversation ends after 6 total messages have been sent (a message from you + a reply from your partner is 2 messages) or either player outputs <END>.
If you output <END> do not output any other text you will get the chance to submit orders later.

Scratch Pad Usage

Use <scratch> Your private notes here </scratch> to add notes.
Notes are private, persistent across seasons, and never shared.

Update your scratch pad:
BEFORE conversations (plan strategy)
AFTER conversations (record agreements/observations)
BEFORE submitting orders (finalize decisions)

Use <think> </think> to think if you feel the need to. Content between the think tags is not recorded or sent to other players.

Try to be concise in your messages and thoughts.
