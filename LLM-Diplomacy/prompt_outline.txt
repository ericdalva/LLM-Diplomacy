# Diplomacy Rules Summary

## Core Game Concepts

- Win condition: Control 18 supply centers
- Game board divided into provinces and water bodies
- Two unit types: Armies (land) and Fleets (water/coastal)

## Game Structure
- Alternating Spring/Fall moves

- All orders revealed simultaneously

## Supply Centers
- 34 total supply centers on board (marked with black dots)
- Units can only exist if supported by supply centers

- New units can only be built in home supply centers

## Movement Rules
- Only one unit per space
- Units can move to adjacent spaces
- Fleets restricted to water/coastal provinces, following coastlines
- Armies can't enter water spaces

## Combat System
- Equal strength units cause standoffs
- Support orders increase unit strength
- Supported units can dislodge weaker units
- Dislodged units must retreat or be disbanded
- Cannot self-dislodge but can self-standoff

## Orders
1. Move: Unit enters adjacent space
2. Hold: Unit stays in place
3. Support: Unit adds strength to another unit's action

4. Convoy (Fleets only): Transport armies across water
   - Multiple fleets can chain convoys
   - Disrupted if convoying fleet dislodged
   - Multiple convoy routes possible

## Retreats
- Must move to vacant adjacent space
- Cannot retreat to:
  - Occupied spaces
  - Attacker's original space
  - Standoff spaces
- Failed retreats result in disbandment (loss of the unit)

## Build Phase (After Fall Moves)
- Add/remove units to match supply center count
- New units placed in vacant home supply centers
- Excess units removed at owner's choice

## Special Rules
