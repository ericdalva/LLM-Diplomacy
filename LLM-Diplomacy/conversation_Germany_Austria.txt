S1901M : Germany - MESSAGE: Austria

I'm Germany, and I'd like to discuss our shared border and potential opportunities for cooperation. What are your thoughts on the current situation, and do you have any proposals for how we can work together to achieve our goals?
Austria - REPLY 1 of 5: To Germany:

I appreciate your message and willingness to discuss cooperation. As Austria, I am open to a mutual non-aggression pact and potential collaboration against common threats. Let us focus on securing our positions and considering how we can assist each other without conflicting interests. A strong Austria and Germany can deter other powers and create opportunities for expansion.

**Orders:**

Austria - REPLY 3 of 5: To address the current situation as Austria, I will proceed with the following strategy:

1. **Secure Rumania**: Move the army from Budapest (A BUD) to Rumania (RUM) with support from the fleet in Trieste (F TRI). This will capture the supply center and strengthen Austria's position in the Balkans.

2. **Maintain Diplomatic Relations**: Continue communication with Germany to uphold a non-aggression pact, ensuring a peaceful northern border and allowing focus on expansion elsewhere.

3. **Monitor Italy and Turkey**: Be cautious of potential moves from Italy and Turkey, especially near the Balkans, and be prepared to adjust strategies if necessary.

4. **Future Expansion Planning**: After securing Rumania, consider moving towards Serbia or Bulgaria in subsequent seasons, ensuring not to overextend and maintaining defensive positions.

5. **Unit Adjustment**: Plan to build additional units in home supply centers during the adjustment phase to maintain military strength.

Orders:
- A BUD - RUM
- F TRI S A BUD - RUM

This approach aims to expand Austria's influence while maintaining strategic alliances and preparing for potential future threats.
